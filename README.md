## Description

It's a small application where you can search, update delete contacts. After the referesh the data will be not saved. For that use your server. For more information please check Work with your own server mode.

## Work with your own server

For that please change IS_LOCAL_DATABASE to false at envinronments/envinronment.ts and change to SERVER_DATABASE to your API address. If you have never written own server, for this project, I recommend: `https://github.com/typicode/json-server`

## Deployed app with local data

You can find the deployed app here: `https://bednayb.github.io/Vodafone/`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
